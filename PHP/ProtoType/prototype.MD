#PROTOTYPE Design Pattern

- The Prototype design pattern allows us to effectively duplicate objects while minimizing the performance impacts of having to re-instantiate an object.

- You may have heard of prototypal languages if you've worked with JavaScript. In such languages, you work by cloning prototypal objects to create new objects; in turn, there is a reduced cost for creating new objects.
