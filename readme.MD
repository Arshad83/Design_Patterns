# Design Patterns
	 *Design Pattern are commonly used to overcome problems in Software Programming*

## Types of Design Patterns
- Anti Patterns
- Creational DP
	- creational patterns can be used to determine how objects should be created
	- Creational design patterns are one of the three types of design pattern commonly associated with the Gang of Four; they are design patterns that concern object creation mechanisms.

	- Instantiating objects or basic class creation on their own, without controlling this process, can result in design problems or simply add additional complexity to the process.
		- Simple Factory
		- Factory Method
		- Abstract Factory Pattern
		- Builder Pattern
		- Prototype Pattern

- Structural DP
	- Structural patterns, we can determine the structure and relationship between classes.
	- Structural design patterns provide different ways to create class structure; for example, this can be how we use encapsulation to create bigger objects from smaller ones. They exist to ease the design by allowing us to identify simple ways to realize these relationships between entities.
		- Decorator
		- Adapter
		- FlyWeight
		- Composite
		- Bridge
		- Proxy Pattern
		- Facade 

- Behavioural DP
- Architectural P


 1.Singleton Design Pattern
 - It has only one instance of class
 - TO get different object Id for same class we use Clone or serialize.
 - But singleton is bad.It violets SRP and Hard to test.
 - Singleton Alternate with Depency Injection.
 
 
 3.Observer Design Pattern
 4.Repository Design Pattern
 5.MVC Design Pattern
